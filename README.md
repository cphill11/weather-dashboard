# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
This is an interactive weather application that allows a user to retrieve weather data for multiple cities.

The dashboard uses form inputs to present a user with current and future conditions for that city, with that data then added to the search history.  Review of current weather conditions for a city presents the city name, the date, an icon representing the weather conditions, the temperatrure, the humidity, the wind speed, but not the UV index as the wrong API was used.

When the future conditions for a city are reviewed, a 5-day forecase displays the date, an icon represening the weather condition, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.

Clicking on a city in search history returns the user to the current and future conditions for that particular city.
